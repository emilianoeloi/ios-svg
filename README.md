## SVG 
"SVG is an XML language, similar to XHTML, which can be used to draw graphics, such as the ones shown to the right. It can be used to create an image either by specifying all the lines and shapes necessary, by modifying already existing raster images, or by a combination of both. The image and its components can also be transformed, composited together, or filtered to change their appearance completely." https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Introduction
